# Hello

Thank you for reading this! This will be a small project I (and maybe others) will work on on the side.

## Please Note

This inital commit does not have good coding standards (non-singluar responsibilty, bad variable names, inconsisent case styles) but I wanted to deploy the app for people to use asap. This code will be refactored, because it is terrible.
